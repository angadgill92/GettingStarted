# Haskell

Haskell is an advanced, purely functional, lazily evaluated, statically typed programming language with type inference.

## Install and Setup your Environment

### Linux

The easiest way to getting started with haskell is by using [Minimal installers](https://www.haskell.org/downloads#minimal) . Minimal installers provide only the [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc) compiler and the [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) and [Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) tools for installing packages. 

- Only the core libraries necessary for each platform are included.
- Cabal or Stack must be used to download and install packages after installation.
