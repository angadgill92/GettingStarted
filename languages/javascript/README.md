# Javascript

Javascript is currently the most popular programming language in the world. It was created by [**Brendan Eich**](https://brendaneich.com/) as a scripting language to be run on browsers. Since then, Javascript has come a long way and can now be used for both client side and server side programming.

Javascript is a good language to get you started with programming since it has _very few restrictions_ as to what you can and can't do with it, but this _freedom_ can also sometimes come back to bite you if you get too careless. That being said, we hope you have fun learning. **Good Luck !**   

## Install and Setup your Environment

### Linux

So here's the bare minimum that you need to get started with javascript on your machine :

* A Web Browser ( Yes ! The one you're using to view this page right now !). Preferably [**Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html#) since it has better dev tools, or if you prefer [**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) .
* The latest version of [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org), which you will find [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions) along with the instructions.

That's all you need to run Javascript, the next section will give you tools to write Javascript.

## Tools for working with the language

### IDEs and Editors

#### Atom `text-editor`

Atom is an _open-source_ text-editor which has been written entirely in Javascript. You can find it [here](https://atom.io/download/deb).

If you've already installed git and would like to get down and dirty then you can go[ here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/build-instructions/linux.md) and follow the instructions.

#### Visual Studio Code `text-editor`

VS Code is another _great_ editor, created by Microsoft. It is built on the same framework that Atom uses (electron) but is snappier than Atom, and handles large text files without breaking a sweat. It also has a better terminal integration. Head over to the [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) for more information. Installing packages is fairly simple here, since VS Code will suggest packages to install based on the type of file you have open.

> **Aside:** At the end of the day, choice of editor is a personal preference. We have added VS Code and Atom because they have been written in Javascript or languages that transpile/compile to Javascript and have better support for JS than anything else out there. Choose whatever editor makes you more productive, and lets you focus on the work at hand.

### Other Tools

#### Linters :

> ##### Atom :
>
>  The first linter you need to install is just called `linter` . To install it, go to your terminal and type this :
>
> ``````
>    $ apm install linter
>    ``````
>  and hit return.
>
>  The second linter you'd need is `linter-js-standard` , ( Note : In order to install this you must install `linter`
>  first).   Just switch back to your terminal and type the following and hit return:
>
>    ``````
>    $ apm install linter-js-standard
>    ``````
