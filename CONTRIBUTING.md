# Contributing

All contributions are welcome. Here are the few notes before you start.

## How to contribute ?

1. Create a document for undocumented language.
2. Improve the existing documentation.
3. **Review** or **comment** on existing issues and pull requests if you have expertise.

## Conventions

Will have a directory for each language under languages directory in root. Each language will have a **README.md** file.  

* The name of each directory should be in lower case.
* To add a new README.md for your specific language copy [template.md](https://github.com/angadgill92/GettingStarted/blob/master/template.md) from root directory of the repo into your newly created language directory. 

#### Writing style

Keep it simple. Be brief and to the point. If you are adding blogs, courses and videos, make sure to include proper working URL's.
